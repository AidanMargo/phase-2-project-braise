Combine wet and dry ingredients and whisk to combine. Pour batter into a drinking glass almost to the top and dip hot dogs. Put corndog straight down into batter and give it a little twirl to fully coat the hot dogs then swirl as you lift up. Let excess drip off. Hold corn dog at an angle in the hot oil for 5-7 seconds to let it seal then drop into oil (this keeps them from sticking to the bottom of the pot).  Fry 3 minutes or until golden brown. Fry up to 2-3 at a time (so you don’t drop the temperature), turning them as needed to brown evenly. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.",

      "image": "http://www.fussfreecooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/a31.jpg",
      "ingredients": "1 small honeydew melon / rockmelon,1 cup sago (tapioca pearls), 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1 cup canned coconut milk  with 1/2 tsp salt",
      "instructions": "Boil sugar and water in a pot until the sugar is completely dissolved and becomes syrupy. Set aside to cool. In a separate pot, boil at least 7 cups of water. When the water is boiling, add sago and cook on medium-high heat until mostly translucent ( sago will dissolve and becomes gooey when overcooked – hence the visible white dots). Also, keep stirring to avoid the sago from sticking to the pot. When the sago is cooked, drain it over a sieve and rinse it under cold running water. Set aside. Use a melon baler, scoop the flesh out. Alternatively, you can dice the melon instead. Keep half the melon portion for later (for serving) and blend the remaining portion using a food processor. Mix the syrup, sago, melon and coconut milk in a large serving bowl. Chill before serving (note – as the mixture chills, the consistency will thicken a little).",
